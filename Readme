# üè• LTC Patient Flow Simulation

This project simulates the flow of patients through a long-term care (LTC) facility using SimPy. It evaluates resource usage, wait times, and service delays to support capacity planning in healthcare.

## Features
- Discrete-event simulation using `simpy`
- Adjustable parameters for bed count, inter-arrival time, and length of stay
- Interactive Jupyter/Colab support

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ltc-patient-flow-simulation.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
